Within the Subscription period of Office at office.com/setup, you are going to wind up paying over $60 more if you go for the monthly subscription. The only advantage of moving with the subscription-based model is that it permits you to install the Office application on more than one computer simultaneously. But to me personally and I guess this is not worth the extra price.
